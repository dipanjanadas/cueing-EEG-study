# cueing-EEG-study

In this study, we were exploring 1. whether cueing the location of a distractor impacts how we process it/experience distraction from it. 2. what the neural mechanisms are underlying behavior when cueing a target v a distractor.

I analyzed beh data first- beh data from this study showed promising benefit of cueing when baseline was compared to distractor cueing condition and to target cueing condition. (scripts here or to be uploaded)

For the EEG data- I first preprocessed the data using standard routine- epoching, baseline correcting, filtering, matching beh to EEG and then re-epoching and baseline correcting to get cue-related activity. (scripts here or to be uploaded)

Then I used an IEM routine to look at the representation of the location when it is being cued by a validly cued target cue or validly cued distractor cue.
